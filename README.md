# XSS-Filter-Bypass-Lab

This GitHub repository hosts a web application intentionally designed with cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities for the purpose of enhancing the skills of security researchers and bug bounty hunters. This project provides a controlled environment where enthusiasts can practice identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, and learn effective methods to bypass security filters. By running this application locally and interacting with its intentionally flawed codebase, users can gain valuable hands-on experience in XSS testing, refine their understanding of web security, and contribute to the broader community's knowledge about securing web applications. Please exercise caution and ensure that you only run this application in a controlled, isolated environment for educational and research purposes.
